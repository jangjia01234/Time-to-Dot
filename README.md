## üí° Inspiration

As someone with poor eyesight, I often struggle to check the time when I wake up in the morning. While VoiceOver can provide the time audibly, it isn't practical in noisy environments or shared living spaces. This personal challenge inspired me to create a more accessible way to tell time for those with similar experiences.

<br>

## ü§î Problem & Solution

- Problem
  - Individuals with mild blindness can visually identify information, but it often requires special tools and effort. Large electronic clocks are commonly used, but these can be confusing due to similar-looking numbers and poor color visibility. Recognizing these challenges, I envisioned a solution that leverages braille, a more distinct and reliable system.

- Solution
  - The Braille Watch App addresses these issues by displaying time in braille, making it easier and more distinct to read than traditional numbers. The app uses a bright yellow color, inspired by tactile paving, to enhance visibility. Additionally, it features a simple alarm function that can be easily activated or deactivated with just a few touches.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Braille Time Display**: Shows time in braille for better clarity and ease of use.
- **High Visibility**: Adopts a yellow color scheme for better visibility.
- **Simple Alarm Function**: Easy-to-use alarm that can be toggled with minimal interaction.
- **Text-Free Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and accessible without relying on text.

<br>

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. **Run the App**: The app is not available on the App Store now, but I'm working on it. Until then, you can build and run the project from the source code.
2. **Listen to the Guide**: Listen to simple instructions by 'How to use' guide with VoiceOver.
3. **Check the Time**: When you open the app, you can see the time in Braille. Just swipe left and right to see hours and minutes.
4. **Set Alarms**: Use touch gestures to easily set or deactivate alarms.

<br>

## üìù Conclusion

While the App is specifically designed for individuals with mild blindness, it is also beneficial for people with low vision and the elderly, providing a more accessible and user-friendly way to check the time. <br>
This App is a step towards inclusivity, offering a practical solution for those who face challenges with traditional time-telling methods. I hope this app enhances daily life and brings greater independence to its users.
